# To compile

syntax : gcc -o [compiled file name] [name of .c file] 

eg : gcc -o output p1.c


         	   # Important note 
		  -------------------
Just use the executable "output" file as complied file name
for all the programs. Each time its compiled the file gets
overwritten. This was we don't need a compiled file for every 
single .c file.

# To run compiled file

syntax : ./[compiled file name]

eg : ./output
